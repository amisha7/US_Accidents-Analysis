# ðŸš§ Analyzing U.S. Traffic Accidents

This project explores patterns and correlations in U.S. traffic accidents to understand the impact of location, weather, and time-based factors on road safety. Using the publicly available dataset from Kaggle, our goal is to uncover insights that can inform better infrastructure, policy-making, and driver awareness.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective
To analyze and visualize U.S. traffic accident data with a focus on:
- Identifying accident-prone locations and times
- Assessing the impact of weather conditions
- Evaluating accident severity patterns
- Creating interactive dashboards for actionable insights

## ðŸ”¬ Key Analyses
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handled missing data, removed irrelevant columns, and applied binning to continuous variables like pressure and visibility.
- **Location-Based Analysis**: Mapped accident distribution across states and cities.
- **Time-Based Trends**: Yearly, monthly, and weekly accident trend analysis to spot peak times.
- **Severity Analysis**: Identified the spread and seriousness of accidents by location and condition.
- **Weather Impact**: Assessed how temperature, humidity, wind, and visibility affect accident frequency.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built a comprehensive dashboard visualizing key metrics for exploration and policymaking.

## ðŸ“ˆ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook / IDEs
- Dataset Source: [US Accidents - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)
